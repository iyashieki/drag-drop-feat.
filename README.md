# Drag & Drop Project

A responsive drag-and-drop project built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.  
Supports both **desktop (HTML Drag and Drop API)** and **mobile (touch events)** so users can move items seamlessly between two dropzones.

## üöÄ Features
- **Desktop support**: Uses the HTML Drag and Drop API (`dragstart`, `dragover`, `drop`) with smooth visual feedback.
- **Mobile support**: Implements touch events (`touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend`) with a ghost element so dragging feels natural on phones and tablets.
- **Clean UI**: Gradient background, rounded cards, hover and drag styling.
